### Print working directory

```sh
pwd
```

### Copy

```sh
cp <source> <destination>
# E.g
cp readme.md readyou.md # create a copy named readyou with the same content as readme
```

### Clear directory

```sh
rm -rf <directory-name>
```

### Move

```sh
mv <source> <destination>
# E.g
mv readme.md .. # Move readme file to parent dir
mv ../readme.md . # Move readme from parent dir to current dir
```

### Rename

- If you move a file within the current directory, that means you are renaming it

```sh
mv <old-name> <new-name>
# E.g
mv readme.md readyou.md
```

### Create

```sh
# Directory: 
mkdir <dir-name>
# File: 
touch <file-name>
```

### Print file content

```sh
cat <file-name>
```

### Echo

#### Print env variable

```sh
echo $USER
# E.g result: 
# >> dangpham112  
```

#### Add content to file

```sh
echo Hello $USER > readme.md
# readme file now have a content: Hello dangpham112
```

## Systemctl

### Restart

```sh
systemctl restart <service-name>
# E.g
systemctl restart ssh
```

### Check status

```sh
systemctl status <service-name>
# E.g
systemctl status ssh
```

## SSH

- Stand for Secure Shell
- [Check SSH score](https://ssh-audit.com/)
- [SSH Hardening Guides](https://ssh-audit.com/hardening_guides.html)

### Connect

```sh
# Access SSH server 
ssh <username>@<ip-address || domain-name>
# Then typing password and press enter
```

### Login with username and password

```sh
ssh <host-username>@<host-ip || host-domain>
# -> SSH will promt you to enter the password
```

### Login with PEM

```sh
# Change permissions for the private key file
chmod 400 <private-key>.pem
# E.g 
chmod 400 MyServer.pem

# Log in via SSH (notice host-username)
ssh -i <private-key>.pem <host-username>@<host-ip || host-domain>
# E.g 1: If you use EC2 Ubuntu the host-username maybe ubuntu
ssh -i MyServer.pem ubuntu@54.251.177.159
# E.g 2: If you use EC2 Amazon Linux the host-username maybe ec2-user
ssh -i MyServer.pem ec2-user@18.141.175.126
```

- Where is PEM file?
  - E.g 1: While you create EC2 instance, you can create key-pair for login in aws console, then they will give you `<private-key>.pem` to store on your SSH-client

### Setup passwordless authentication

```sh
# On SSH client
# Generate a new SSH key pair using the Ed25519 algorithm
ssh-keygen -t ed25519
# -> You can leave all the command prompts empty, just press enter
# -> You should notice the location of file *.pub for further actions 

# Copy the public SSH key to the SSH server 
ssh-copy-id -i <public-key-file-location> <host-username>@<host-ip || host-domain>
# E.g
ssh-copy-id -i /root/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub ubuntu@123.213.32.1
# Test the connection
ssh <host-username>@<host-ip || host-domain>
# -> SSH server will no longer ask you a password
```

### Disable root login

```sh
# Open the SSH daemon configuration file
vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# in [sshd_config] -> Find PermitRootLogin and set it to no
PermitRootLogin no
# in [sshd_config] -> Find PasswordAuthentication and set it to no
PasswordAuthentication no
# Restart the SSH Service
systemctl restart ssh
```

### Secure copy

#### From SSH-client to SSH-server

```sh
# On SSH-client

# From SSH-Client to SSH-Server
scp <path-to-file> <host-username>@<host-ip>:<destination>
# E.g
scp ~/Documents/readme.md ubuntu@18.141.184.34:~/Document/
# Or
scp -i <private-key>.pem <path-to-file> <host-username>@<host-ip>:<destination>
# E.g
scp -i ~/Auth/MyServer.pem ~/Documents/readme.md ubuntu@18.141.184.34:~/Document/

# From SSH-Server to SSH-Client
scp <host-username>@<host-ip>:<path-to-file> <destination-on-client>
# E.g
scp ubuntu@18.141.184.34:~/Document/readyou.md ~/Documents
# Or
scp -i <private-key>.pem <host-username>@<host-ip>:<path-to-file> <destination-on-client>
# E.g
scp -i ~/Auth/MyServer.pem ubuntu@18.141.184.34:~/Document/readyou.md ~/Documents
```

## Nano

- A default text editor of some OS

### Open file

```sh
nano <file-name>
# E.g
nano index.html
```

### Save

1. Press `Ctrl` + `x`
2. Press `y`
3. Press `enter`

## Setup root password

- If your root user does not yet have a password

```sh
# Gain root privileges
sudo su
# Set a Password
passwd root
# -> Enter and confirm the password
```

## Nginx

- Capacity: 2MB

### Install

```sh
sudo apt install nginx
```

==> Press `Tab` ->> Choose `OK` and then press `enter`

### Open ports

- After installing Nginx, we may not be able to access our website because the firewall is enabled by default
- If you use EC2, the firewall is disabled by default, but your EC2 `Security Group` will block access to your website
  - You must edit the inbound rules to allow traffic on HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443)

#### Check firewall status

```sh
sudo ufw status
```

- `ufw`: ubuntu firewall

#### Let's firewall allow nginx

```sh
sudo ufw allow "Nginx Full"
```

### Locate the index file

```sh
ls /var/www/html
```

### Locate configuration file

```sh
/etc/nginx/sites-available
# Activate the configuration for Nginx
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/<my-config>.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
# Test config syntax
sudo nginx -t
# Restart nginx
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

## SSL Certificate

### Let's Encrypt SSL/TLS certificate

- Issued at **no cost** by the Let's Encrypt Certificate Authority
- Provides [**Domain Validation (DV)**](/docs/research/be_protocol/tls_ssl/#domain-validation) certificates
- Certificates are valid for **90 days**, but they can be **renewed automatically** with **Certbot**

```sh
# Install Snap
sudo apt install snapd

# Ensure stability and compatibility for all snap packages
sudo snap install core; sudo snap refresh core

# Install Certbot
sudo snap install --classic certbot

# Ensures that Certbot is accessible system-wide
sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot

# Obtain and install a certificate for a website running on Nginx
# Automatically configuring Nginx to use HTTPS
sudo certbot --nginx
# -> Certbot will prompt you to provide some information

# Test automatic renewal
sudo certbot renew --dry-run
# -> If the dry run is successful, you'll see output similar to:
# Congratulations, all renewals succeeded
```

- **Certbot**: A popular tool for obtaining and managing SSL/TLS certificates from the **Let's Encrypt** Certificate Authority

### Certificates for localhost

```sh
openssl req -x509 -out localhost.crt -keyout localhost.key \
  -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -sha256 \
  -subj '/CN=localhost' -extensions EXT -config <( \
   printf "[dn]\nCN=localhost\n[req]\ndistinguished_name = dn\n[EXT]\nsubjectAltName=DNS:localhost\nkeyUsage=digitalSignature\nextendedKeyUsage=serverAuth")
```
