# Evil Twin Attack

- A type of MitM attack
- Description: The attacker sets up a rogue Wi-Fi access point that mimics a legitimate network. Devices connect to it, allowing the attacker to intercept all traffic.
- Key Characteristics:
    - The rogue network often has a similar name to the real network (e.g., "FreeWiFi").
    - Victims unknowingly connect to the attackerâ€™s network.
- Prevention:
    - Educate users to verify SSIDs before connecting.
    - Use enterprise-level Wi-Fi with mutual authentication (e.g., WPA2-Enterprise).
