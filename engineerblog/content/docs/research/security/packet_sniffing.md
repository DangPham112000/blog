# Packet Sniffing

- A type of MitM attack
- Description: The attacker uses tools like **Wireshark**, **tcpdump**, or **Kismet** to capture packets traveling through the Wi-Fi network
- Key Characteristics:
    - Often passive (doesnâ€™t modify the traffic, just listens)
    - Works well on unencrypted networks or with weak encryption like WEP

## Prevention:

- Use strong encryption (WPA3 is ideal, WPA2 is acceptable)
- Avoid unencrypted public Wi-Fi
- Encrypt all messages that go through the internet

### Install necessary packages

```sh
sudo apt update
```

- Aircrack-ng:
    - Airmon-ng is a utility in the Aircrack-ng suite that helps set up a wireless network card into monitor mode
    - Airodump-ng: Captures data packets from nearby wireless networks

```sh
sudo apt install aircrack-ng
```

- Wireshark is a network packet analyzer

```sh
sudo apt install wireshark
```

### Let's go

```sh
# Check wireless interface
iwconfig
# -> E.g output
lo        no wireless extensions.
enp4s0    no wireless extensions.

# Disconnect the wireless adapter from managing a network
sudo airmon-ng check kill

# Enable monitor mode on your wireless adapter
sudo airmon-ng start wlo1

# Verify

          Retry short limit:7   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off
          Power Management:on
# -> Your wireless adapter with monitor mode is now wlo1mon

# Capture packets
sudo airodump-ng wlo1mon
sudo wireshark
# -> Use Wireshark to capture packets on the wlo1mon interface
```

- Stop capturing packets (exit monitor mode)
```sh
sudo airmon-ng stop wlo1mon
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
```
