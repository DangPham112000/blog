## Dictionary attack

### Use case

- A dictionary attack is a method of breaking into a password-protected computer, network or other IT resource by systematically entering every word in a dictionary, or word list, as a password
- A dictionary attack can also be used in an attempt to find the key necessary to decrypt an encrypted message or document

### How it works

- If it target to an orgization, or a paticulally person. the dictionary can collect all the `gan gui` words around the factor they want to hack, combination all of them in all the possible ways then try each to guess the pass or key they want to hack

### Prevention

- Avoid passwords: the passwords can be hacked if we dont use password for login (funy huh). At the system view we can totally avoid it by using password-free authentication solutions and biometric logins 
- Use random passwords: At the user view, dont you closely information like (name, pet, birthday) or the easy to predict words (like password, abcd, xyz, 123) to create a password. instead, using random string, if you see it's difficult to remember them then you can use some 3rd-party password manager to store them (of course, you need to choose the trustworthy one)
- Two-factor authentication
- Limit login attempts
- Force resets
